# Loan_Prediction_Using_ML

Abstract

In our banking system, banks have many products to sell but main source of income of any banks is on its credit line. So they can earn from interest of those loans which they credits. A bank’s profit or a loss depends to a large extent on loans i.e. whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting. By predicting the loan defaulters, the bank can reduce its Non-performing Assets. This makes the study of this phenomenon very important. Previous research in this era has shown that there are so many methods to study the problem of controlling loan default. But as the right predictions are very important for the maximization of profits,it is essential to study the nature of the different methods and their comparison. A very important approach in predictive analytics is used to study the problem of predicting loan defaulters (i) Collection of Data, (ii) Data Cleaning and (iii)Performance Evaluation. Experimental tests found that the Naïve Bayes model has better performance than other models in terms of loan forecasting. Key Words: Machine Learning, SVM, Naïve Bayes,Prediction.


Introduction 

Loan Prediction is very helpful for employee of banks as well as for the applicant also. The aim of this Paper is to provide quick, immediate and easy way to choose the deserving applicants. Dream housing Finance Company deals in all loans. They have presence across all urban,semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for loan after that company or bank validates the customer eligibility for loan. Company or bank wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer details provided while filling application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and other. This project has taken the data of previous customers of various banks to whom on a set of parameters loan were approved. So the machine learning model is trained on that record to get accurate results. Our main objective of this project is to predict the safety of loan. To predict loan safety, the SVM and Naïve bayes algorithm are used. First the data is cleaned so as to avoid the missing values in the data set.
